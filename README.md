##Letterboxd Data Scraping
This code is for scraping letterboxd watchlist data and more, to determine commonality between users' movie watchlists. It could definitely use better organization and commenting. I'm working on a refactor, and I have big plans for this once I find time around classes! Data on movie ratings you disagree with friends the most on, which you agree the most on, making it into a fully accesible web app, and getting official API access from Letterboxd so I don't have to data scrape like a hacker!


Version history here is limited as I was working in a private repo before that had friends' usernames hardcoded.
